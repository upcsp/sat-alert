*  This program is a template that can used for building client programs    *
*  for PREDICT.  This program functions by sending a data request to the    *
*  server (the machine on which PREDICT is running in server mode), and     *
*  retrieves the response from the server.  Some parsing is required to     *
*  extract information from PREDICT's response and fill variables as        *
*  needed.  Examples of how this is done are shown in this sample program.  *
*                                                                           *
*  This program defaults to "localhost" as the name of machine on which     *
*  PREDICT is running in server mode.                                       *
*                                                                           *

*  This program was originally written by Ivan Galysh, KD4HBO, 24-Jan-2000  *
*  and has been modified extensively since.  Most recently, Bent Bagger,    *
*  OZ6BL, provided a patch to detect the absence of a PREDICT server,       *
*  and print an error message to that effect.                               *
*                                                                           *
